### Summary
> Welcome to Pickle Clicker, an incremental game based on pickles.

> You just click the pickle and get a pickle out of thin air. Not only that, but with your pickles you have the ability to purchase and further enhance your pickle picking empire by buying auto pickles. 
But watch out! The more pickles you have, the more Poglins eager to come and steal your pickles, so defend and fight back with the purchasing of upgrade pickles.
