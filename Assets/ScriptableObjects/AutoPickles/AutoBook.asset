  description: You sit at your desk and pull out a book given by your late grandmother.
    Within contains the story of an artifact that grants the user the ability to
    create juicy moist pickles. As you flip through the pages a piece of paper falls
    out. After inspecting it you unfold as to what seems like a map. Too tired to
    do any further research you decide to hit the hay.
