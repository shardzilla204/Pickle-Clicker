  description: Today is one of the many great days of harvest at the pickle farm.
    You get ready in your worn out attire and put on the musky gloves that reek of
    pickles due to previous uses of past generations. You then begin picking the
    pickles into your basket and soon after finish up in the afternoon, walking back
    home.
